## 🧹 Step 1: Data Cleaning with MySQL

### Sample Queries Used
```sql
-- All customers
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Total customer count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

-- Chennai market transactions
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';

-- Distinct products in Chennai
SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code='Mark001';

-- USD transactions
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency='USD';

-- Transactions in 2020
SELECT t.*, d.* 
FROM transactions t 
INNER JOIN date d 
ON t.order_date = d.date
WHERE d.year = 2020;
```

### Total Revenue in 2020 (Currency Normalized)
```sql
SELECT SUM(t.sales_amount) 
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN date d ON t.order_date = d.date
WHERE d.year=2020 
AND (t.currency='INR' OR t.currency='USD');
```

---

## 🔄 Step 2: Loading Data into Power BI  
- Connected **MySQL database** to Power BI  
- Loaded dimension & fact tables:  
  - DimCustomer  
  - DimMarket  
  - DimProduct  
  - DimDate  
  - FactSales  

---

## 🧽 Step 3: Power Query Transformations  

Key transformation tasks:
- Used **First row as headers**  
- Corrected datatypes  
- Removed duplicates in FactSales using SQL + Power Query  
- Created conditional columns (currency normalization)

### Normalized Sales Amount Formula
```powerquery
= Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount",
each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] ="USD#(cr)"
then [sales_amount] * 75 else [sales_amount], type number)
```

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Data Modeling  
Designed a **Star Schema**:

**FactSales**  
↳ DimCustomer  
↳ DimMarket  
↳ DimProduct  
↳ DimDate  

Relationships were verified using primary keys and foreign keys.
